Dear Sirs,
 
Pls. find the updated D20 BIOS of 8/23, 
About the TEL mode data can't delete issue, I can't find any failure. pls. check again.
For the room monitor application, you can set the cmd=0x5E0F ( Codec path: MIC -> AD0 & LIN -> AD0 & DA -> LOUT ).
You had better to disable S/W ALC setting during room monitor mode or in whole line mode. Otherwise, if loop gain is too big, the howling is occurred.
If you set Codec path via IN/OUT register directly, you can refer to below setting or refer to the demo program "RingMode.asm" -- DAA_MONITOR_ON: function.
     LIPK 6
     OUTL 0x8E85, ANALOG_POWER_REG
     OUTL 0x0B,ANALOG_SWITCH_REG      
     OUTL 0x00CB, ANALOG_MUTE_REG 
 
 
Change Summary (compare to D20_070814V2.obj) ----> This version is only for Asset, the pubic version will keep using GPB0 & GPB1 as Interrupt pins.
1. Remove cmd=0x5F42, 0x5F44 for old S/W ALC  (New S/W ALC don't support these two cmd again )
2.  Replace External Interrupt Pin GPB0 & GPB1  by GPB6
